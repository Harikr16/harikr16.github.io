<div  style="font-size: large;">

<p align='left'> &emsp;&emsp; This was a mini-project which was born out of my desire to get the latest and greatest data for my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/hot_topics_in_ml" > Machine learning trend analysis </a> project. Over here I extracted all the NIPS research papers through webscraping.</p> 

<p align='left'>  &emsp;&emsp; Although it was a big challenge, I enjoyed learning Javascript for the project. I used Python (BeautifulSoup) and JS to extract all NeurIPS research papers and when I felt the code is slow, I parallelized it using Multiprocessing library to reduce running time from 4+ hrs to 20 mins. (yay!)

<p align='left'>  &emsp;&emsp; I have made the code pubicly available through my Github (link below) and am really glad that its helping people around the world.
