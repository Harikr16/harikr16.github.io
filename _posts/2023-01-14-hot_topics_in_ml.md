Machine Learning has been 'the' trending topic atleast in the past decade. With this project, I try to discover the hot topics within Machine Learning through analysis of research papers published in NeurIPS conference.</p>

Discovering latent topics is an unsupervised learning task. For this purpose, I implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm and identified the top 10 ML topics.

Out of Curiosity, I also analyzed how this trending topics have been evolving since the beginning. I utilized zero-shot learning and classified the topics of each research paper, which was then animated to visualize their evolving relevance through years.
